# Incorrect usage of $in operator in MongoDB query
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries.  The incorrect example shows a syntax error that may not be immediately apparent to those unfamiliar with the intricacies of MongoDB query operators.  The solution illustrates the correct syntax for using the `$in` operator for efficient data retrieval.

## Problem
Incorrect spacing or placement of the curly braces `{}` around the `$in` operator can lead to errors and unexpected query results.  MongoDB requires a specific structure for the query to be parsed correctly.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct format, ensuring correct operator placement within the query structure.  This ensures MongoDB correctly interprets the query and retrieves the intended results.
